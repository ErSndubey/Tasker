To-Do List

This is a simple web-based to-do list application that allows you to manage and keep track of your tasks. You can add tasks with titles, descriptions, and priority levels. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so your tasks will persist even if you refresh the page or close the browser.

Features:
- Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and priority levels.
- Mark tasks as complete or remove them from the list.
- Tasks are sorted by priority, with high-priority tasks displayed at the top.
- Edit task details by clicking on the task title.
- Local storage integration for data persistence.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project serves as a simple demonstration of building a to-do list application using front-end web technologies. It can be used as a starting point for further customization and enhancement based on your specific requirements.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, or use it as a reference for your own to-do list applications.
